# house_price_prediction : This was my capstone project in my final semester of JGI MCA 

- Challenges faced :

  • High multi-collinearity between several predictor variables, redundant features required merging with meaningful external data.
  
  • Presence of junk characters, nulls, literal “nan” etc and outliers which needed feature engineering, outlier treatment and encoding 
  categorical columns.
  
- Tools / techniques used :

  • Google colab along with pandas, numpy, Sci Kit learn, visualization libraries etc.
  
  • Techniques include preprocessing with data merge, feature transformation, outlier detection and treatment, study of visualization graphs, model evaluations and hyperparameter tuning by GridSearchCV.
  
  • Model selection based on regression metrics parameters.
  
- Model Selection :

  • Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor models were evaluated on the basis of metrics like R-squared, Adj R squared, RMSE etc.
  
  • Linear Regression was selected as the best model.
  
- Project outcome :
  
  • Machine learning regression model to predict home prices for buying and sellng, without the help of external assessors.
